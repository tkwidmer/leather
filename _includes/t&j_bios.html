  Teagan is a Bootblack based out of Oakland, CA. The first time she shined a pair of shoes, it was under her father’s watchful eye as a child before church. However, these days her skills are being put to more ... salacious uses. Upon joining the leather community she soon began exploring the eroticism surrounding leather care. Working a stand, she began to develop an identity as a spiritual bootblack. She views herself as a healer. Mixing sage oil in with some of her products she seeks to purify both the leather and it’s owner during their time in her stand.

  Teagan and Jesbian first found connection and their D/s relationship through boots and cigars. Their mutual love of leather has brought them together. The pair are committed to serving their community through bootblacking, facilitating classes, and volunteering at numerous events. Once in a blue moon they take a weekend off. When not participating in the leather community they enjoy playing cribbage and watching Rachel Maddow.
