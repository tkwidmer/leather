  Teagan is a Bootblack based out of Oakland, CA. The first time she shined a pair of shoes, it was under her father’s watchful eye as a child before church. However, these days her skills are being put to more ... salacious uses. Upon joining the leather community she soon discovered that taking care of leather was a 'thing.’ She began to hone her craft starting by caring for the leathers of her close friends and lovers in 2013 and then decided to undertake more formal mentorship in early 2015. She identifies as a spiritual bootblack. She views herself as a healer, seeking to purify both the leather and it’s owner during their time in her stand.
