    <h3> Booking </h3>
    <p>
    I'm available to bootblack around the bay area and around the country at conferences, bars, parties, and other events. I own my own portable stand and a shoeshine box, but am happy to work on any equipment you already have set up. You can <a href="/contact/"> contact me</a>.
    </p>

    <h3> Tipping Guidelines </h3>
    <p>
    Give what you are able, but give something. I do not charge for my work, but I accept tips. My average tip is 10-30 dollars depending on how much work is involved and the size of the project. I am open to exchanges / trades that are not monetary as well. No one turned away for lack of funds.
    </p>

    <h3> Services </h3>
    <p>
    I specialize in the care of both high shine and oil tanned boots as well as leather garments. In general the services I offer can be described as maintenance, care, and cosmetic improvement. If it's leather there's a good chance I can do <b>something</b> with it.
    </p>

    <h3> Products </h3>
    <p>
      I clean with a glycerine soap that I buy online and alter myself. I primarily work with Angelus products on high shine boots (<a href="http://angelusdirect.com/collections/shoe-polish/products/angelus-black-shoe-wax">Polish</a>, <a href="http://angelusdirect.com/collections/conditioners/products/lustre-cream-3-oz">Lustre Cream</a>). On garments and oil tans, I'm much more flexible but primarily use <a href="http://www.huberds.com/shoe-grease.html">Huberd's Shoe Grease</a> and <a href="http://www.obenaufs.com/Heavy-Duty-LP-8-oz-p/heavy-duty-lp-8.htm"> Obenhauf's Leather Preservative </a>. I also use a home made Dubbin and <a href="http://www.cedarshoetree.com/meltonian-cream-1oz-p-28.html"> Meltonian Creme Polish </a> in certian situations. There are a few other products I use less often.
