          Before Internet dating and hookup apps, The Handkerchief code was largely used by gay men in the 1970’s to distinguish sexual preferences and fetishes in gay clubs and on the streets of places like San Francisco and New York. In Hanky Code: The Movie, Periwinkle Cinema, San Francisco’s queer experimental film collective brings Queer and Trans* filmmakers across a spectrum of genres, styles, genders, and locations to dissect the code in this epic anthology feature of more than 15 short films! Each filmmaker or filmmaking team tells a story of a different color/fetish of the code.
