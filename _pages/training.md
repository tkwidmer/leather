## Leathercare & Bootblacking

I studied the art of leather care under Scout IMBB 2014. I was approved to start bootblacking
publicly in June of 2015, and was given permission to accept the title of Southern California
Bootblack in April of 2016. I've also taken classes and picked up valuable skills from slave
tabitha (IMsBB 2015), Bam-Bam (IMBB 2015), and Bootblack Beta (First RunnerUp IMBB 2016).
