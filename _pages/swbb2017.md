    <h1> Southwest BootBlack 2017</h1>
    <p>
      In January of 2017 I competed for and won the title of Southwest Bootblack 2017. I'm looking
      forward to representing bootblacks this year in Southwest region and beyond. Although my home
      is Oakland, CA you can find me bootblacking and teaching all over the state in the upcoming year.
      I most often am found on the patio working the stand at the SF Eagle on 12th street in
      San Francisco, CA.

    <p>
      A big thank you to the Southwest Leather Conference and it's producers Master Judi and Tina
      for creating this wonderful stage for us spiritual bootblacks and for supporting me in this
      title. And to all the judges for giving me this opportunity.
