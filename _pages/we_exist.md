      Trans folk who were assigned male at birth are often made invisible and forgotten by the communities and spaces in which they exist every day. The leather and BDSM communities are no different. The contributions and mere presense of trans women are often ignored. <em> We Exist </em> is a photo essay that seeks to highlight the faces and stories of trans women who exist in leather and BDSM communities.

      <h4>#1 - Isabelle </h4>
      <p>
        Isabelle is a bootblack and a resident of the Folsom district in San Francisco. She and her partner run a public safe space for trans women out of their apartment. The space doubles as a leather working shop and the pair have been learning to sew and with the hope of producing leather garments.
