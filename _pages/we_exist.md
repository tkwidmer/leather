The contributions and presense of trans women are often ignored.

      Isabelle is a bootblack and a resident of the Folsom district in San Francisco. She and her partner run a public safe space for trans women out of their apartment. The space doubles as a leather working shop and the pair have been learning to sew and with the hope of producing leather garments.
