# Boots

I'm a bootblack based out of Oakland, CA. I was trained by Scout (IMBB 2014) in early 2015. I'm available to bootblack publicly around the bay area and around the country. I own my own portable stand, but am happy to use any stand you may already have.

#### Previous Venues
Venues that I've blacked at are as follows:
- Folsom Street Faire
- Venus Playground @ Folsom
- Dore Alley Street Faire,
- The SF Eagle,
- The SF Citadel
- Alchemy SF

#### Booking
If you are looking for a bootblack for your event, please send me a message. If my schedule allows it, I'd love to black your event. You can also email me at tkwidmer [at] gmail [dot] com.
