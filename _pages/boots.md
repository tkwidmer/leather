    <p> I'm a bootblack based out of Oakland, CA. I was trained by Scout (IMBB 2014) in early 2015. </p>

    <p> I do take dropoff comissions, but really prefer to work with you 'in person' on your leather. I firmly believe that my role is about more than tending to just your leather goods. My ultimate goal is to make both you and your leather feel and look better when you leave my chair than when you sat down in it. Besides, the experiance is far less enjoyable for both you and myself. </p>

    <p>I can often often found at bars and events arround the bay area. You can find my <a href="#schedule">  upcoming schedule </a> below. I also have a personal chair in my backyard and can sevice your leather goods at my place. Please send me an email at tkwidmer [at] gmail.com to schedule a private blacking session. </p>

    <h2> Products </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>
      I clean with a glycerine soap that I buy online and alter myself. I primarily work with Angelus products on high shine boots (<a href="http://angelusdirect.com/collections/shoe-polish/products/angelus-black-shoe-wax">Polish</a>, <a href="http://angelusdirect.com/collections/conditioners/products/lustre-cream-3-oz">Lustre Cream</a>). On garments and oil tans, I'm much more flexible but primarily use <a href="http://www.huberds.com/shoe-grease.html">Huberd's Shoe Grease</a> and <a href="http://www.obenaufs.com/Heavy-Duty-LP-8-oz-p/heavy-duty-lp-8.htm"> Obenhauf's Leather Preservative </a>. I also use Mr S Leather's Dubbin and <a href="http://www.cedarshoetree.com/meltonian-cream-1oz-p-28.html"> Meltonian Creme Polish </a> in certian situations. There are a few other products I use less often.
    </p>

    <h2> Compensation </h2>

    <p>
      I do not charge for my services, but I will greatfully accept tips for a job well done. These tips help me replace my products as well as improve my home stand and provide transportation to and from bootblacking gigs.
    </p>

    <p>
      When blacking at a bar my usual tips are usually between 10-30$ a pair of boots/shoes/garmet depending on the amount of work and product used. More for larger pieces of leather / complicated detail work / complex restoration and repair. I'm also open to other types of exchange. I only have one guideline: give what you are able.

    <h2 id="booking"> Booking </h2>

    <p>
      I'm available to bootblack around the bay area and around the country at conferences, bars, parties, and other events. I own my own portable stand and a shoeshine box, but am happy to work on any equipment you already have set up.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are looking for a bootblack for your event, please send me a message. If my schedule allows it, I'd love to black your event. You can also email me at tkwidmer [at] gmail [dot] com. I black at events for free, and usually accept tips from customers (although this can be negotiated).
