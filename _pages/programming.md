# Programming

### Summary

I am a self taught software developer with a background in object oriented programming. I endeavor to write code that is clean, elegant, and innovative. I have a proven track record as a quick learner and I love to dive headfirst into new concepts. I have a history of success that proves that I can learn how to do anything at an expert level.

I am not currently looking for an opportunity. But I would listen to an interesting job prospect. I am however not interested in relocating away from the SF Bay Area.
