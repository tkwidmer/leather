<h3> Bootblack Schedule for The Playground </h3>
<h5> Folsom 2016 </h5>

<p>
Have you ever had the dream of doing the hot boots and leathers of your community at the world famous Folsom Street Fair? The Playground (Formerly known as “Venus Playground”) is looking for bootblacks of all skill levels to work the stands inside The Playground.
</p>

<p>
This year we will have two stands this year, so you will be working with alongside another bootblack for your shift. If you are feeling a little nervous or haven’t worked in public very much: don’t worry! We will pair you up with a more experienced Bootblack.
</p>

<p>
Please note that The Playground’s admission policy is that you must <u><b> not identify as a cisgender man </b></u> (all other identities are welcomed) to be admitted. This admission policy applies to both volunteers (bootblacks) and attendees.</p>

<p>
As always, any tips you make will be yours to keep! You worked hard for them!
</p>

<p>
If you are interested please send me a PM message with what shift you are interested in!
