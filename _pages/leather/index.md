excerpt: "Teagan is a Bootblack based out of Oakland, CA. She shined her first pair of shoes under her fatherâ€™s watchful eye as a child before church. However, it has only been more recently that she has honed her craft and incorporated her technical skills into her leather practice."

    <h3> Tipping Guidelines </h3>
    <p>
    Give what you are able, but give something. I do not charge for my work, but I accept tips. My average tip is 15-30 dollars depending on how much work is involved and the size of the project. I am open to exchanges / trades that are not monetary as well.
    </p>

    <h3> Services </h3>
    <p>
    I specialize in the care of both high shine and oil tanned boots as well as leather garments. In general the services I offer can be described as maintenance, care, and cosmetic improvement. If it's leather there's a good chance I can do <b>something</b> with it.

    <h3> Booking </h3>
    <p>      
    I'm available to bootblack around the bay area and around the country at conferences, bars, parties, and other events. I own my own portable stand and a shoeshine box, but am happy to work on any equipment you already have set up. You can email me at tkwidmer [at] gmail [dot] com.
