#### Description
Is your leather feeling dry? Did it get dirty from that kinky camping trip? Want to get your leathers looking sharp for that event tonight? Feeling overwhelmed about where to start? Have no fear! This class will give you the skills and confidence to perform basic maintenance and care on your leathers. Together we will learn the basics of leathercare and how to build a basic kit for leather care. We will also delve a little bit into the ‘whys’ of leather care. Please bring some leather to tend to and any products you already own, the last part of the class will be hands on!
