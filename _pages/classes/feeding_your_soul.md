## Feeding Your Sole: Basic Leathercare for the Average Leatherperson.

#### Description
Is your leather feeling dry? Did it get dirty from that kinky camping trip? Want to get your leathers looking sharp for that event tonight? Feeling overwhelmed about where to start? Have no fear! This class will give you the skills and confidence to perform basic maintenance and care on your leathers. Together we will learn the basics of leathercare and how to build a basic kit for leather care. We will also delve a little bit into the ‘whys’ of leather care. Please bring some leather to tend to and any products you already own, the last part of the class will be hands on!


#### Bio
Teagan is a bootblack based out of Oakland, CA. She first shined her a pair of shoes under her father’s watchful eye as a child before church. However, it has only been more recently that she has honed her craft and incorporated her skills into her leather. She began taking care of the leathers of her close friends and lovers in 2013, and decided to undertake more formal training in early 2015 under IMBB 2014 Scout. She started bootblacking in public later in 2015 at local venues and events in the bay area including International Ms Leather, Leather HEAT, The SF Eagle, The Armory, Up Your Alley, and the Folsom Street Fair. In 2016 she had the honor of being appointed the title of SoCal Bootblack. She can most often be found working the stand on the patio stand at her home bar, the SF Eagle.
