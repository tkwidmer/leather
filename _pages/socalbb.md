    <h1> SoCal BootBlack 2016</h1>
    <p>
      In April of 2016 I was appointed SoCal Bootblack 2016. I'm looking forward to representing
      bootblacks this year in California and beyond. Since the title is transitioning to become
      California State Bootblack next year, I will not only be focused on Southern California
      but on the entire state of California as I hope to build a good class of contestants next year
      for the first California State Bootblack Contest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although my home is Oakland, CA, you can find me bootblacking and teaching all over the state
      in the upcoming year. I most often am found on the patio working the stand at the SF Eagle on
      12th street in San Francisco, CA.

      A big thank you to Leather HEAT and my producers Master George and slave bren for believing
      in me and supporting me in this title.
