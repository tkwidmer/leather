## About Teagan

I am a self taught software developer with a background in object oriented programming. I endeavor to write code that is clean, elegant, and innovative. I have a proven track record as a quick learner and I love to dive headfirst into new concepts. I have a history of success that proves that I can learn how to do anything at an expert level. Currently I am seeking an entry level position or intern level position in the tech industry with an ambition to become a professional software developer. I hope to use the experience I will gain in an entry level position to familiarize myself with the industry, product development, and the technologies needed to develop elegant and functional code. </p>

In addition to my software development am also a writer, educator, and artist. I currently hold an MFA in Theatre Pedagogy from Virginia Commonwealth University and a BA in English from Pacific Union College. I write about gender, the performing arts, and pop culture. I've lectured and presented my work at numerous schools, conferences, and events around the United States. My writing has been published on <a href="http://www.autostraddle.com/">Autostraddle</a>, <a href="http://interruptmag.com/">Interrupt Magazine</a>, <a href="http://youngist.org/">{Young}ist</a>, and <a href="http://spectrummagazine.org/">Spectrum Magazine</a>.</p>

I live in the sf bay area. I like to imagine that in the future I will sit down reading a good book next to a roaring fire in a den with lots of bookshelves.</p>
