<h3> Dore 2017 </h3>

<p>
Hey everybody! It's time for Dore Alley. As always we will be located on Dore Alley in between Folsom and Howard.
</p>

<p>
There will be some light snacks and water for you. Jesbian will be running front of house selling tickets
and interfacing with you making sure you have everything you need. She'll be given a break by Jay. And Connor will be on hand as a runner too! As always, any tips you make will be yours to keep! You worked hard for them! 10$ ticket fee goes to Project Open Hand. We do a ticketing system similar to that employed by IMsL. Lowest ticket number gets to go when there is a free chair.
</p>

<p> We still could use some help tearing down and loading up the car at the end of the day. </p>
