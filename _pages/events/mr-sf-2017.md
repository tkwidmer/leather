  <h3> Douglas Ambrose</h3>
  Bootblack Chair 1
  <br><br>
  Since moving to San Francisco in 2013, Douglas has been refining his skills at various leather events in the local and national leather communities.  He is currently the resident Bootblack for Mr. S. Leather in San Francisco, and one of the community Bootblacks at the San Francisco Eagle.  Through blacking, Douglas has been able to share his own story while helping to hold space for others to share theirs.
  <br><br>
  Douglas self-identifies as an Alpha slave, this has, helped him develop and maintain a focus on the bootblacking craft while furthering his love for boot and leather care.  This focus on precision and detail fuels his own style of discovery, born of teaching moments with his mentor and fellow Bootblacks.  One of those discoveries was “Bootblack Alchemy,” a process of mixing products to test their results. This practice allows him to be flexible and open to sometimes unexpected results, fueling a response that is rooted in the presence of the moment and experience.
