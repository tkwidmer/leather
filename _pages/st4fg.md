It's February 18th, 2015. So far this year there have been 7 high profile murders of trans women in the states. 7 dead trans women that I know about due to being murdered. In addition, after the tragic suicide of teen Leelah Alcorn near Christmas of last year, I am personally aware of about 6 suicides of trans women since the new year. We are dying. We are being slaughtered at the hands of others and at our own hands. And it is REALLY hard.

I live about a mile from where Taja DeJesus was stabbed in the Bayview district of San Francisco. And on some days I am anxcious. I'm afraid. Almost every day I get harassed by men on the street. Sometimes leaving the house is hard.

This last week I spent most of it in a really self destructive place. On Wednesday, in the car on the way to therapy, I breifly contemplated driving instead to the Golden Gate Bridge. That's real. But that's not how I want to live. I want to survive. I don't want the transphobic society to win. I want to surive.

And so I started thinking about the things in my life that I do to find resiliance. Sometimes it's a simple as eating a bowl of Ice Cream with peanut butter and chocolate on top. Other days it's about surrounding myself with the love, care, companionship, and presense of another trans woman.

I really want to hear what other trans women are doing to stay alive. How are you surviving? What little (or big) things do you intentionally do to make life easier for yourself? To give yourself a little peace from the storm?

## Why "Future Girls"?

Basicly because [I've been listening to the GLOSS demo. Which you should totally go buy right now.](http://girlslivingoutsidesocietysshit.bandcamp.com/) (I'll wait, I promise.) Honestly I made a bandcamp account just to support them.

GLOSS is a hardcore band based out of Olympia, Washington. I freaking love this demo. All 8 minuites of it have been on repeat for me, over and over again. On the first song from the demo, <em>"G.L.O.S.S (We're from the Future)"</em> Sadie yells


> THEY TOLD US WE WERE GIRLS/HOW WE TALK, DRESS, LOOK, AND CRY/

> THEY TOLD US WE WERE GIRLS/SO WE CLAIMED OUR FEMALE LIVES/

> NOW THEY TELL US WE AREN'T GIRLS/OUR FEMININITY DOESN'T FIT/

> WE'RE FUCKING FUTURE GIRLS LIVING OUTSIDE SOCIETY'S SHIT/

And for some reason the phrase "Future Girls" and the whole notion of trans women living outside of society stuck with me. Almost every day it feels like

I know that not every label is for everybody. But I liked this one, so I'm using it. If you don't like it, don't identify with it, or don't want to use it for any reason, maybe you can still participate and share your survival tips under the hashtag `#SurvivalTips4TransGirls` - because I know I'd like to hear your survival tips, even if you don't like the term "Future Girl."
